# Set the environment variable to allow tmux to use ssh-agent using

# From the man page: when the tmux server is started, the environment is copied
# to tmux global env. Additionally, a session environment is also created for
# each session and for each new window, the session and global environment are
# merged.
# So before you start the tmux server, make sure the fd is in the correct
# place to avoid any errors (doesnt have to be a live link as it can be
# updated when the socket dies and a new one is created). This comes in handy
# when the socket dies and a new one is created and the existing windows need
# the new socket.

# shell process which overrides the global tmux env var.
