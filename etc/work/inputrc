# The following is useful if you regularly use commands that need enclosing
# brackets/quotes.
# If the files start with an escapable character (in this case brackets/quotes)
# then, in conjuction with autocompletion, there will be an unwanted (in most
# cases) closing charater at the end of the completion. Hence the bindings
# include a space charater as well.
# So now one needs to press the char followed by 'space' character in order to
# have the complement appear.
